Real Estate Engagement

File: Property_Click_Prediction.ipynb

Overview:

The project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of interactions (clicks or views) a property will receive within a specific timeframe of its activation on a real estate platform. By analysing historical property data and interaction patterns, the model strives to forecast property engagement, which can be valuable for real estate businesses aiming to optimise property listings and marketing strategies.

Key Features:

Data exploration and preprocessing of property features (e.g., size, location, amenities) and interaction timestamps.
Feature engineering, including calculating time-based features and handling categorical variables.
Implementation and training of classical machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) and potentially a deep learning model.
Model evaluation and comparison using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.
Feature importance analysis to understand the key factors influencing property interactions.
Handling imbalanced datasets for classification tasks (predicting interaction categories).

Technologies:

Python,
Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
XGBoost,
Keras

Expected Outcomes:

A machine learning model capable of predicting the number of interactions a property will receive.
Insights into the predictive power of various property features and their impact on user engagement.
Performance metrics of different models, highlighting the most accurate approach for this task.
Understanding of the challenges and limitations of predicting property interactions in the real estate market.
