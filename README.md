TikTok Content Classification: Claims and Opinions:
	This Jupyter notebook classifies TikTok content into claims and opinions using machine learning techniques.

Project Overview:
	The notebook aims to develop a model that can automatically distinguish between factual claims and subjective opinions in TikTok video content. This classification is crucial for content moderation and understanding user-generated content on the platform.

Key Features:
		Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing TikTok video text data for analysis.
		Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing and understanding the distribution of claims and opinions in the dataset.
		Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from the text data to improve model performance.
		Model Development: Implementing and training machine learning models for classification.
		Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the classifiers using various metrics.
	 
Technologies Used:
		Python
		Pandas for data manipulation
		Scikit-learn for machine learning models
		Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
Usage:
To use this notebook:
		Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
		Load your TikTok content dataset.
		Run the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
Expected Outcomes:
		A trained model capable of classifying TikTok content into claims and opinions.
		Insights into the characteristics of claims vs. opinions in social media content.
		Performance metrics of the classification model.
		This project contributes to the broader field of content analysis and moderation in social media platforms.
