Data Science Portfolio
===========================================================================

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for data science projects:

1. Amazon Stock Price Direction
2. TikTok Content Moderation
3. Employee Churn for HR Department

Project 1: Amazon Stock Price Direction
---------------------------------------

File: Prediction_of_Stock_Price_Direction.ipynb

Overview:
The project focuses on creating  machine learning algorithm designed to forecast the directional movement of Amazon's stock price. By analyzing historical stock data, the model aims to predict whether the price will rise or fall. This predictive capability could prove invaluable for traders seeking to make well-informed investment decisions.

Key Features:
- Data exploration and analysis of historical Amazon stock prices.
- Feature engineering, including calculating moving averages and price ranges.
- Implementation and training of classical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and a deep learning model (Feedforward Neural Network).
- Model evaluation and comparison using the AUC metric on validation and test sets.
- Feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of stock price direction.

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Tensorflow

Expected Outcomes:
- ML capable of predicting the direction of Amazon stock price movement.
- Insights into the predictive power of various features (e.g., trading volume, moving averages).
- Performance metrics of the different models, highlighting the best-performing approach for this task.
- Understanding of the challenges and limitations of predicting stock price movements.

Project 2: TikTok Content Moderation
---------------------------------------

File: classifying-claims-and-opinions-in-tiktok-content.ipynb

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to classify TikTok video content into claims and opinions. The classification is crucial for content moderation and understanding user-generated content on the platform.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing of TikTok video text data
- Exploratory data analysis of claims and opinions distribution
- Feature engineering for text data
- Implementation and training of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

Expected Outcomes:
- A trained model for classifying TikTok content
- Insights into characteristics of claims vs. opinions in social media
- Performance metrics of the classification model

Project 3: Employee Churn Prediction
---------------------------------------------------

File: salifort-motors-predicting-employee-churn.ipynb

Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for employee churn at Salifort Motors. The analysis will help in developing retention strategies and improving workforce planning.

Key Features:
- Exploration of employee data to identify churn factors
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering from employee data
- Implementation and training of machine learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Expected Outcomes:
- A trained model for predicting employee churn
- Insights into factors contributing to employee turnover
- Recommendations for improving employee retention

Usage Instructions:
-------------------

For both notebooks:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Load the respective datasets
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
4. Interpret results and model outputs

Note: These notebooks require a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab) and appropriate datasets to run successfully.
