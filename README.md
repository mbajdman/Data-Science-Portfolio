TikTok Content Classification and Salifort Motors Employee Churn Prediction
===========================================================================

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks for data science projects:

1. Prediction of Amazon Stock Price Direction
2. Classifying Claims and Opinions in TikTok Content
3. Predicting Employee Churn for Salifort Motors

Project 1: TikTok Content Classification
---------------------------------------

File: classifying-claims-and-opinions-in-tiktok-content.ipynb

Overview:
This project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to classify TikTok video content into claims and opinions. The classification is crucial for content moderation and understanding user-generated content on the platform.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing of TikTok video text data
- Exploratory data analysis of claims and opinions distribution
- Feature engineering for text data
- Implementation and training of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

Expected Outcomes:
- A trained model for classifying TikTok content
- Insights into characteristics of claims vs. opinions in social media
- Performance metrics of the classification model

Project 2: Salifort Motors Employee Churn Prediction
---------------------------------------------------

File: salifort-motors-predicting-employee-churn.ipynb

Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model for employee churn at Salifort Motors. The analysis will help in developing retention strategies and improving workforce planning.

Key Features:
- Exploration of employee data to identify churn factors
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering from employee data
- Implementation and training of machine learning models for churn prediction
- Model evaluation and performance assessment

Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Expected Outcomes:
- A trained model for predicting employee churn
- Insights into factors contributing to employee turnover
- Recommendations for improving employee retention

Usage Instructions:
-------------------

For both notebooks:
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Load the respective datasets
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially
4. Interpret results and model outputs

Note: These notebooks require a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Google Colab) and appropriate datasets to run successfully.
