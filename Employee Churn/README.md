Employee Churn Prediction

File: https://github.com/mbajdman/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Churn/Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb

Overview: 

Developed machine learning models to predict employee turnover for an HR department. Analysed employee data to identify key factors influencing departure and built classification models to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving.

Key Features:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explored the dataset to understand variables, identified and handled duplicates, and assessed potential outliers. Data Visualisation: Created various plots (boxplots, histograms, scatterplots) to visualise relationships between variables and understand patterns related to employee turnover. Feature Engineering: Engineered new features and dropped potentially misleading ones to improve model performance. Model Building: Constructed and evaluated several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Random Forest. Model Evaluation: Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC on both training and test datasets. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilised GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for tree-based models through cross-validation. Model Comparison: Compared the performance of different models to determine the most suitable one for the prediction task.

Expected Outcomes:

Identification of key drivers of employee turnover: Insights into which factors (e.g., working hours, projects, satisfaction level, tenure) are most strongly associated with employees leaving the company. Development of predictive models for employee turnover: Trained and evaluated models capable of predicting which employees are at risk of leaving. Recommendation of the best-performing model: Selection of the most effective model based on evaluation metrics and considerations of potential data leakage. Actionable insights for the HR department: Data-driven information that the HR department can use to improve employee satisfaction and retention strategies.
